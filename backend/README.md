# Velvo

Velvo is a YouTube-inspired video streaming platform currently under development. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), it aims to replicate core YouTube features such as video uploads, playback, user authentication, and community engagement functionalities.

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development**: This project is actively being built, and features are being added iteratively. Contributions and suggestions are welcome!

## Planned Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration functionality using JWT.
- **Video Management**: Upload videos with metadata like title, description, and tags.
- **Video Playback**: Smooth streaming with an embedded video player.
- **Engagement Tools**: Enable likes, dislikes, and comments on videos.
- **Search and Filter**: Search for videos and apply filters based on tags or categories.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or similar service for storing video files (planned)
